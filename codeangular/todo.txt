To Do list:

few points:
1. do not use '_' prefix in folder's names
2. move stuff from _globalComponents to /src/app/shared
3. put each pipe to separate file
4. delete file's comment with your name :)

delete file /assets/.gitkeep
clean _models/index.ts file


just remove not needed lines from there

see 4 files imports, but exists only ./user

Unit tests for components
Directives
Recapcha code

need modal option for delete campaign with text (Do you really want to delete this campaign?)
after delete you have to reload table



* Code refactored.
* Separated pipes.
* Tried to make some generic components.
* Studied unit test cases and directives and form validations.
